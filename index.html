    My  name  is  Tzanka,<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    I have creative background and experience in Animation, film and illustration.<br>
    <br>
    My interests developed further into learning to code, so I can manage and control <br>
    <br>
    visualy better the projects I am  working on.<br>
    <br>
    I am beginner in learning proggramming and advanced in creative disciplines and <br>
    <br>
    my aim is to level both, so that I can be more flexible starting and acomplishing 
   projects in the future.<br>
    <br>
    Digital world attracts me a lot with its endless opportunities for creativity 
    and progress.<br>
    <br>
    I am very good at problem solving and hope to participate some  very exiting 
   creative progects in the future <br>

   <h3> 1.1 </h3>
    IT is an impropved communication, more and endless opportunities and majic tool<br>
     for creation of very exiting content.<br>
    IT is of great importance in the modern world and it brings new dimension to business <br>
    and human relationship with its interactivity and hidden marketing power. <br>
    Its yet to be found what else IT can became in the near future with <br>
    Artificial Inteligence and development of smatr technologies and robotics.<br>
    
    <h3>1.2</h3>
    I think its always been the case where you have this grait idea and you try to get it alive.<br> 
    Everything starts with the idea and the development tools are the one, <br>
     which could be chosen accordingly.<br>
    In business primarelly it will be business /commersial need which sets the agenda.<br>
    For every project commersial or artistic, the tools could be choosen specyficly. <br>
    In my humble understanding about the process the most important is the management and<br>
     colaboration, media is secondary,  but also of great importance.<br>
    In modern days there are wonderfool tools online where the creative and work process<br>
     could be shared between the team.<br>
    
    <h3>1.3</h3>
    It is difficult to simplisise the ideas as we all are used to visually interact with great examples of imagery and desigh online
    on a daily basis. The challenge here will be again translating complex ideas into something visually  basic but readable
     and decently functional from designer point of view.
    For my project I set up a trello board .<br>
     Follow link : <a href=" https://trello.com/b/7gzSwJDw/html-project-tzanka">My trello board</a>
    I started researching the topics of "All written content document" and came to the idea that I really would like my website to 
    reflect me and my journey learning to code. It will be the case that concept development and research will grow toghether into
    hopefully nice product.
    
   <h3> 1.4</h3>
   <br>
    Good planning is essential in any work.That whats make progects successfull or not  
    Deffinetely it is a spine of any progect and espessially in digital enviroment where 
    you dont produse pfisical 3 dimentional objects its the key for  success or fail.
    Planing need to cater for all technological requirements , team building , work carried and purpose fulfield.
    Having the right appropriate equipments, but also full set of right proffesionals.
    Digital projects are very complex now a days  and require a lot of different expertise and experience.
    Decent Digital projects is more team work and efford as per their complexity.
    The tasks easilly could be devided in IT
    <br>
    <h3> 1.5 </h3>
    <br>
    All projects will have pre set requirements which need to match team  proffecional skills and equipment.
    For my project I needed to adapt  and complete the task with what I have. This will reflect the quality of the product.
    I only can use HTML and SCC to that level I managed to learn and I had to upgrade my laptop in the process of work.
    In Ideal situationall these conditions will be fulfield and the best equipment/ professionals will be chosen to complete 
    the projects.There will be at least few options choosing the right software, but of course every 
    field has leaders and quality deffined standards. In terms of other equipment its again depends on the project.
    <br>
    <h3>1.6</h3>
    <br>
    I am new to theese platforms and that  makes me extreemly exiting user.
    Tey are both great tools for work, communication and colaboration.
    I used Trello ones before and its gtreat for planning and keep yourself organised . Has a lot of features and tools to use 
    and ease your work as well allow colaboration and team work.
    For this specyfic HTML/SCC website project is more like talking to youself. It helps shaping the product , setting deadlines 
    and organising work.
    GitHub is going further and you can share your code, there are tasks everyone can work on and you can get feedback from fellow and 
    more advanced developers.I didnt used it yet as the scale of my project and dead line wouldnt allow me, but will look into it 
    in the very near future.

   <h3>1.7</h3> 
    <br>
    GDPR is a set of legal requirements, when it comes to collection and storage of personal information of individuals 
    in the EU. In the UK  there is a special body ICO which regulates and monitor. 
    The first Data protection low is from 1995 and it have been updated in 2018 and regulate how the business process and handle
    personal information. It has 7 key principels outlined in Article 5 of the document
    There is really nice publiction, explaining all about it in detail as it is huge topic.

    <h3>2.1</h3>
    <br>
    I am happy with the tools I am using for that project and I would like to be able to use more features od SCC 
    that I am curently been able to due to the begginer stage of my  developers experience.
    Visual studio is a great tool and it works with every programming language. 
    I like the convinience of this tool, user frendly appearence and suggestive tool helping you with the 
    right spelling of the code.
    I suspect when and if I advance this tools will not be enough. IT requires constant learning and I think this is one of the things, 
    which attracts me so much to it.
    <br>
    
    <h3>2.2</h3>
    <br>
    I think they are absolutelly appropriate for the stage we are in in our coding experience and 
    the tools are very well chosen. They allow variety and flexibility in work and have all nessesary elements 
    for completeing the projects required.
    The tools itself can add, but cannot replace the human impact  and creative approach yet.
     Thats why in my work I wouldnt empficyse on tools so much.
    For me visual side of the project is more important and in previous creative experiences I had, tools were important ,
    but not pre defining the outcome.
    <br>
    
    <h3>2.3</h3>
    <br>
    The strenght in my project will be all this years of experience I have on creative field. I completed many projects
    with limited resources or tools, or I needed to discover how something could be done  in the process of work.
    Weeknes is my begginer codding experience and the tight deadline also some computer issues in the process.
    I am looking foreword to see what |I can actually achieve after I write completely this lenghty text required for the
     website.
    <br>
    <h3>2.4</h3>
    <br>
    There it will be most deffinetelly, that more improvements will be added to  my website, 
    espessially if I am going to use it as an example in my portfolio.
    Limitation of my skills makes me anxious about the final product, which will not match my visual expectations
    at firs. That is something I need to work on and constantly improove.
    Most of the websites are constantly updated, eddied and improoved,
    and I can see that will be the case with this project.
    Its like writting a novel when you just learn the alphabet. 
    <br>
    </h>2.5</h3>
    <br>
    It is the most and must  important part of the project to malke sure the requirements are met.
    In this particular thask, surtain set of indormation should be gathered and displeyed on the website.
    This website shpuld represent our abbility to work with a text, imagery and code to build complex products.
    I can devide it to research phase,concept and layout pfase and codding /testing  pfase.
    I am sure some of the elements will be beter represented in different projects and for me balancing all those elements 
    will be of great importance.
    Checking the product versus brief constantly is something of majour importance.

    <h3>3.1</h3>
    <br>
    Being beginner in the digital field its too early to clculate efficiency one way or another. 
    We startded codenation with a group task to make a Pythongame. It was extreemly exiiting to work in a team and see how
     every tem member adds to the proget.
    Without this the projects would not have been that well thought wouldnt implement everyones strong points.
     But I realise  it could be oposite too. 
    For this individual project would be really interestinng to see how to develop individual project and see what sides of 
    my skillset  need  improoving.
    I suppose the scale of the project defines the partisipants , but its interesting to try both. 
    <br>
    <h3>3.2</h3>
    Productivity and efficiency is a product management question rather than anything else.
     IT and software side  of the project is important part espessially in a digital progect. Efficiency and productivity can be 
    better monitored with digital tools and it ongoing problem in any project from start to the finish.
    It could be managed and improoved when you compare to similar projects and its difficult to judge on single projects
    if the tamescale  cas stisfied.
    <br>
    <h3>3.3</h3>
    I have some experience managing a team in different productive enviroment. Its important to assign manageble tasks 
    to memebers of the team. Make sure their skillset best match the tasks they are assign. Closely monitor the deadlines and
    completion of the tasks on time. Check versus the brief for the task.
    In therms of my productivity with this project I will be more organised in delivering different components  of the task.
    And I ll be more strict with myself in therms of deadlines.
    <br>
    <h3>3.4</h3>
    I suppose I need to test it on various platforms and brousers to make sure its correctly displayed  troughout differnt 
    applications. Have no prticular extended experience  in testing and as it is separate field from anything I did so far in my career.
    After I researched I found that:
    Digital testing solutions cover: functional testing, compatibility testing, test automation, performance testing,
    accessibility, security testing, and user acceptance and user experience(UX) testing. That covers every aspect of digital testing

    <h3>Unit 2, Outcome 1 </h3>
    <br>
    <h3>1.1</h3>
    <br>
    my web cite is  in still on concept  stage.<br>  
    During the development stage Layout  and content will change . It is still work in progress 
    and all elements will be functioning toghether the content and the imagery wil lead to further lead  of ideas
     some of which to be explored and developed.
    I had a basic idea to divide my website on 2 separate functioning collumns: one with the researched (all written content)
    data and the other with my own journey trough IT.
    Due to the luck of cnowlege in the field I decided to simplify the content and the approach and 
    wrote my point of view on the topics.
    I will further try to present the actual data into a pleasant and simple website expressing me as adeveloper and creative person
    to the best of my knowlege.
    <br>
    <h3>1.5</h3>
    My website will contain all my original artwork and imagery and where needed 2-3 website references will be added as 
    links leading leading to this particular sources.
    In therms of copyright all will be properly copirighted and linked and there will not be any violation of the curent 
    copirignt standerds. low and requirements.
    <br>
    <h3> 1.6</h3>
    <br>
    I will  not be able to add any features to reflect disability users  enchanced experience.
     I will not be able to do that simply due
     to the  short deadline and compete luck of knowlege how to do that with the tools I have .
    As it is ongoing process I will try to add some of this feature to my web site and I will research the best practices
    and experience to do so 
    <br>
    <h3>1.7</h3>
    Curently I dont want to set any limits to my project , but I will definetelly go for more expressive memeorable
     filetype fonts for my website. The content side of the project should be represented  and displayed by readable fonts 
    but avoiding most heavyly used one and basic ones such as Times new Roman as per Liam Cookson advise.
    I will have a detailed  look into Google fonts and some other free fonts sourses and see what could be 
    implemented in my work and best meet short deadline createria.
